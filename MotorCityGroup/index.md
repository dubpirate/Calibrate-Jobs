No cars were literally scraped in the making of this script. 

The aim of this program was to get the pertinant details of cars for hire from the (City Motor Group)[https://www.citymotorgroup.co.nz/]
website in order to input them into a mailchimp email template. I came very close to fully automating
the process of recieving which cars' details needed to be scraped, scraping them, and formatting them
into an email, but unfortunately I left Calibrate before I could complete it. 

At this point, all it does is take all the details necessary and puts them into a csv where the first 
cell is the ID number, as well as downloading the display image.
