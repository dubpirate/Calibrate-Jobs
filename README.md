# Calibrate-Jobs
Hello! These are some python scripts I've written for my job at Calibrate marketing. 

## `clean.py`
This script is for cleaning contacts from one batch to another. It takes two csv's and removes already seen contacts, as well as junk contacts or test submissions to a form (people working at my marketing firm).

## `scrape_cars.py`
I helped write a monthly newsletter for a car company, and used this program to scrape the details of the cars from the website.
