# Hello There!

This folder is for the odd scripts I wrote during my time at Calibrate Marketing.

## clean.py

One of my jobs was to clean csv's with contact details in them. This included removing duplicates, 
reformatting the values in certain cells, and exporting the cleaned contacts into new files; you 
know, typical csv stuff.
