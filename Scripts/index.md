# Hello There!

This folder is for the odd scripts I wrote during my time at Calibrate Marketing.

## clean.py

One of my jobs was to clean csv's with contact details in them. This included removing duplicates, 
reformatting the values in certain cells, and exporting the cleaned contacts into new files; you 
know, typical csv stuff.

## car_scraper.py

No cars were literally scraped in the making of this script. 

The aim of this program was to get the pertinant details of cars for hire from the [City Motor Group](https://www.citymotorgroup.co.nz/)
website in order to input them into a mailchimp email template. I came very close to fully automating
the process of recieving which cars' details needed to be scraped, scraping them, and formatting them
into an email, but unfortunately I left Calibrate before I could complete it. 

At this point, all it does is take all the details necessary and puts them into a csv where the first 
cell is the ID number, as well as downloading the display image.
